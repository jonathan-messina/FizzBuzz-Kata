# FizzBuzz-Kata

https://www.codewars.com/kata/584c702256c98fc0a0000043

Task

You need to implement a function that applies the standard fizz buzz test:

    If a number is divisible by 3, return Fizz
    If it is divisible by 5, return Buzz
    If it is divisible by both 3 and 5, return FizzBuzz
    If it is not divisible by 3 or 5, return the number itself

However, when making the function, you cannot use if (meaning else is also not an option).
Input

    A number will always be provided
    The number provided will always be positive and an integer

Examples

    6 should return Fizz
    10 should return Buzz
    15 should return FizzBuzz
    17 should return 17
